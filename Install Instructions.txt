To start a basic Transcibe node you need to do the following steps.

1. Install AllStarLink and setup as Hub (No Radio Interface)

2. Edit RPT.conf to turn on Recordings then edit extensions.conf(Examples provided in TSN/AllSta-CONF) as by default AllStar triggers recordings on COS since a hub does not have COS we need it to trigger recording when a PTT sesion is started and end when PTT sesion ends

3. Edit push-taas-wavs.sh set "WATCH_DIR" to the directory your Recordings are stored in and set your SFTP Info along with where your Audio files should be transfered to for your transcriber script to pickup

4. Set push-taas-wavs.sh to start on boot with a Service or other method (Starting Manually works fine for testing aswell)

5. On your Transcription server (Can be on same machine) place the transcribe_watcher.py and transcribe_and_log.py

6. Edit transcribe_watcher.py set your "WATCH_DIR" to the same directory you set "REMOTE_DIR" to in push-taas-wavs.sh dont forget to edit Line 28 to match the location of your transcribe_and_log.py

7. Edit transcribe_and_log.py to set your MySQL server info

8. Place your callsign_extractor.py on the machine you plan to do callsign extraction

9. Edit callsign_extractor.py setting your MySQL server info and if your using QRZ Validation and if you are set your QRZ XML Api log in information

10. Setup transcribe_watcher.py to start on boot

11. Do a test connection and verify recordings are making it into the correct file and being transcribed into the database.
